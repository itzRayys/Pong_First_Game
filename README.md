# Pong_First_Game

This project is the last version of my first game, Pong.

It took me about 2 and a half weeks to complete. 
I started the project the day I completed the free course "C# Fundamentals for Absolute Beginners" by Bob Tabor

Completing this game helped me learn a lot of Unity's basics and get ready to start my second, more independent project.
You can check out the github page of that at https://github.com/itzRayys/next-game

Side note: Only the last version is being uploaded since I didn't know about Github before then to upload versions of it.
