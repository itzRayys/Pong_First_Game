# Pong_First_Game

This project is the last version of my first game, Pong.

It took me about 2 and a half weeks to complete. 
I started the project the day I completed the free course "C# Fundamentals for Absolute Beginners" by Bob Tabor

Completing this game helped me learn a lot of Unity's basics and get ready to start my second, more independent project.
You can check out the github page of that at https://github.com/itzRayys/next-game

Side note: Only the last version is being uploaded since I didn't know about Github before then to upload versions of it.


To download and play the game, download the PongGame.zip file (if it asks to keep the file or remove, click the arrow and click "Keep".
After it downloads, find the file and right click it then select "Extract" and choose a location.
After it extracts, go into the folder and run the PongGame.exe to play the game.

Dev note: After testing on a different PC with a different screen resolution, I saw that the controls were cut off on the bottom left. I assume this has something to do with
  something I did while making the game and scaling it to my screen's resolution (1920x1080) and ignoring other resolutions (The other pc I tested on).
  
I probably won't go back and fix it as this was just a starter small project but I will be aware of it for my future projects and will make sure
  it doesn't happen on my second project that I'm currently working on. Enjoy!
